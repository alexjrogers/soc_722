### Notes

This is where I'm keeping my notes and code for the data wrangling section of modern dive.


```{r}

portland_flights <- flights |> 
  filter(dest == "PDX")
View(portland_flights)


```

```{r}
btv_sea_flights_all <- flights |> 
  filter(origin == "JFK" & (dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA") & month >= 10)
View(btv_sea_flights_all)


```
