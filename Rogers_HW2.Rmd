What is going on with my Y axis labels when I run this code?:


ggplot(data = nc, aes(x = weeks, y = weight)) + 
  geom_point()
  
  
  
  
  
  I am uploading this code to save it. When I generate the scatterplot my y axis labels are overlapping and messy. I am going to try starting over. I also noticed an error when I loaded the spreadsheet, that I was missing a library called curl so it was using url instead. I'm going to try to install the curl package.
